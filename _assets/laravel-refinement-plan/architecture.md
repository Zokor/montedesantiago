# Laravel CMS — Architecture Review & Core Structure Plan

## 1. Overview

Describe the current Laravel CMS architecture and how it maps to the original vanilla CMS.  
Identify the core modules, models, controllers, and their relationships.

## 2. Architectural Comparison

- **Vanilla CMS structure:** summarize major directories and logic.
- **Laravel structure:** summarize corresponding parts.
- **Differences / misalignments:** list them here.

## 3. Proposed Unified Architecture

Define how the system should be organized moving forward, including:

- Folder structure
- Naming conventions
- Component system architecture
- Data model hierarchy
- Integration between backend (Laravel) and frontend (Inertia + React)

## 4. Key Architectural Goals

- Maintainability
- Extensibility (components, field types, API)
- Headless compatibility
- Support for Blade-rendered pages
- Clear separation between data, presentation, and configuration

## 5. Implementation Notes

Add any relevant insights or constraints from the existing code or setup.

---

✅ **Output goal:**  
Produce a finalized architectural structure (folders, models, relationships, and patterns) that supports both traditional and headless use cases.
