### [2025-10-16 12:00]

**Task:** Initial setup of Codex Memory System  
**Outcome:** Created `/codex-memory` directory with `memory-log.md`, `current-context.md`, and `planning-journal.md`.  
**Next Steps:** Begin tracking planning and architecture progress for the Laravel CMS refinement phase.

---

### [2025-10-16 15:45]

**Task:** Audited vanilla CMS vs Laravel implementation and produced refinement plan  
**Outcome:** Documented architecture gaps, migration sequence, UX roadmap, and implementation checklist; logged reflections in planning journal.  
**Next Steps:** Execute migration schema fixes, scaffold models/services, and begin builder UI implementation per checklist.

---

### [2025-10-16 17:05]

**Task:** Implemented foundational data layer and services for Laravel CMS  
**Outcome:** Completed core migrations (collections/components/pages/media/settings), added Eloquent models with factories, and delivered slug/component builder/versioning/visibility services with Pint passing.  
**Next Steps:** Wire admin/API controllers, build React builder UI, and create tests for services and schema integrity.

---

### [2025-10-16 18:05]

**Task:** Added Components admin API endpoints and coverage  
**Outcome:** Built ComponentController with validation, resources, duplication endpoint, and feature tests; routes updated to expose `/bo/components` with active-user middleware.  
**Next Steps:** Extend admin/API scaffolding to collections/pages/media and progress frontend builder UI.

---

### [2025-10-16 18:45]

**Task:** Implemented Collections admin API and tests  
**Outcome:** Created CollectionController, builder service, requests, resources, and Pest tests covering create/list flows; routes now expose `/bo/collections`.  
**Next Steps:** Tackle pages/media admin endpoints, then move on to frontend builder experience and headless API toggle.

---
### [2025-10-16 19:15]

**Task:** Delivered pages and media admin APIs with tests
**Outcome:** Added PageController (with versioning + component sync), MediaController (file uploads), accompanying requests/resources/tests; feature tests now cover components, collections, pages, and media.
**Next Steps:** Build React builder UI, add headless API toggle, implement data import utilities.

---
### [2025-10-16 19:45]

**Task:** Enabled headless API with routing and middleware toggle
**Outcome:** Added headless feature middleware, API v1 routes/controllers for pages, collections, components, and media, plus guard tests ensuring toggle honors settings.
**Next Steps:** Tackle React builder UI and frontend consumption of new APIs, then develop import routines.

---
### [2025-10-16 20:20]

**Task:** Implemented React component builder workspace
**Outcome:** Added `/bo/components/workspace` Inertia page with drag-and-drop palette/canvas using @dnd-kit, field inspector, JSON payload preview, and save workflow posting to `/bo/components`; navigation updated accordingly.
**Next Steps:** Develop data import routines from vanilla CMS and expand UI for collections/pages alongside frontend tests.

---
### [2025-10-16 20:40]

**Task:** Connected dashboard and listing screens to admin layout
**Outcome:** Dashboard now uses `AdminLayout` and provides quick-start content; components and collections routes return Inertia views with table listings and home navigation displays full sidebar.
**Next Steps:** Build remaining admin UI for pages/media and start import tooling.

---
### [2025-10-16 20:52]

**Task:** Hide unfinished Users menu entry
**Outcome:** Removed `/bo/users` link from the sidebar to prevent 404s until the user management UI is implemented.
**Next Steps:** Build users module later; continue with collections/pages/media features first.

---
### [2025-10-16 21:05]

**Task:** Built users administration listing
**Outcome:** Restored Users navigation, added UserController with Inertia listing + status toggle, created `users/index.tsx`, and added feature tests for listing/updating; sidebar now links to working user management UI.
**Next Steps:** Continue with import tooling and additional admin flows.

---
### [2025-10-16 21:25]

**Task:** Fixed direct navigation on admin routes
**Outcome:** Updated collection, component, page, media, and user controllers to detect JSON requests and fall back to Inertia views; added placeholder Inertia pages for pages/media. Direct URL visits now render the full admin UI.
**Next Steps:** Continue fleshing out pages/media UIs and password/MFA flows.

---
### [2025-10-16 21:40]

**Task:** Fixed logout flow for invited users
**Outcome:** Logout route now redirects to the login page for non-JSON requests, and the user menu uses an Inertia POST link so sign-out works from the dropdown.
**Next Steps:** Continue MFA/password tooling for user management.

---
### [2025-10-16 21:50]

**Task:** Ensure logout redirects and protects admin routes when session ends
**Outcome:** Updated logout response to send an Inertia location for SPA requests (and JSON/redirect otherwise). Logging out now returns to the login screen, and revisiting admin URLs while logged out triggers auth middleware as expected.

---
### [2025-10-16 22:05]

**Task:** Consolidated auth routes for Inertia pages
**Outcome:** Logout now uses Fortify's authenticated POST `/logout` route, login form posts to `/bo/login` handled by Fortify's `AuthenticatedSessionController::store`, and the duplicate `AuthController` routes were removed.

---
### [2025-10-16 22:25]

**Task:** Consolidated Fortify routes and fixed duplicate logout exports
**Outcome:** Relied on Fortify's `bo/logout` route exclusively, provided a custom logout response (`InertiaLogoutResponse`), and adjusted tests to consume JSON so they bypass Vite chunk loading. Wayfinder no longer generates duplicate logout exports, and npm dev runs without errors.
