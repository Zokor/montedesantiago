# Current Context — Codex Working Memory

This file summarizes the **current active goals, context, and pending actions** in the CMS planning workflow.  
Codex should read this file at the beginning of each session to re-establish state and continuity.

---

## 🧩 Current Stage

Architecture review complete. Ready to execute schema completion and scaffold core CMS modules (models, services, builder UI) following the new refinement plan.

---

## 🎯 Active Objectives

- [ ] Wire admin/API controllers and resources for collections, components, pages, media, and settings.
- [ ] Design React builder workspace (palette/canvas/inspector) and DataType form components leveraging shadcn + @dnd-kit.
- [ ] Stand up headless API layer (`/api/v1`) guarded by new feature flag and integrate with settings toggle.
- [ ] Author Pest tests covering migrations, services (slug/builder/versioning/visibility), and model relationships.

---

## ⚙️ Pending or Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Map vanilla component data to new schema during import command development.
- [ ] Plan Blade rendering layer that mirrors headless JSON schema for front-end parity.
- [ ] Draft testing matrix (feature + browser tests) covering builder workflows and media uploads.
